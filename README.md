# after creating an executable jar file. We can run it by the following command
# java -jar <JAR_FILE>
# by default it will run on the port 8080. But we can change it using command line properties.

# before running the executable, run the following command
# java -jar <JAR_FILE> --server.port=8888
# now it will run on the port 8888

# or we can also change the port in the properties file
